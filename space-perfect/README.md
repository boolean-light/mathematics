As written in the intro of the paper, this was a problem proposed by Prof.Iitaka.

He had already pinpointed the value of $\alpha$ when $k=6$, but similar proofs with other $k$ were not known, so he proposed this as a problem in a seminar on 2025.04.16.

I proved the first theorem in the paper on 2025.04.17, which showed that the solutions of $\sigma(\alpha)=2\alpha+2k$ can be written as $\alpha=k p (p:\mathrm{prime}, \gcd(k, p)=1)$ or $\alpha=2^e q^f$.

However, it was not quite trivial to simplify the condition of $e, f$ necessary for $\alpha$ to be the solution of second kind (called pseudo-prime solutions by Prof.Iitaka).

When I was summarising the outcomes to publish here in Github later, I realised I could use results from elementary group theory about the order of an element, and proved the second theorem in 2025.08.08.
