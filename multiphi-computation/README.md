The first idea for this came up in January 2025.

At first, I was considering to calculate multiphi by using algorithm similar to depth-first search of a large graph, with nodes representing positive integers and edges representing multiplying/dividing by prime numbers.

This quite got stuck early when I tried to extend this idea into $\varphi^3, \varphi^4$ and further beyond, and it was inconvenient not to be able to calculated multiphi of n in ascending order of n anyway.

I created the algorithm you see now sometime between February to June 2025, and added some optimisations like parallelization and wheel-sieve-like-optimisations of spaces later.
