The idea of generalising $\dfrac{\varphi(n)}{n}$ to $\dfrac{\varphi^k (n)}{n}$ was quite natural after considering generalisation of co-totient.

I created a first proof of the weak condition $\mathrm{rad}(n)=\mathrm{rad}(m)$ in 2023.10, but later it found out to be quite faulty.

(proof of $n\sim_{\varphi^k} (m) \Longleftrightarrow \mathrm{rad}(n)\cdot \dots \cdot \mathrm{rad}(\varphi^{k-1}(n))=\mathrm{rad}(m) \cdot \dots \cdot \mathrm{rad}(\varphi^{k-1}(m))$ was correct, 
but the very last part of the proof of $\varphi^k$-equivalence implying $\mathrm{rad}(n)=\mathrm{rad}(m)$ was incorrect.)

I fixed it and provided a complete proof in 2025.04.

I later simplified the proof and added the strong condition, so proofs you see now were done in 2025.05.
